"""Various assert methods to massage core-like objects for nose's rich asserts.

Nose provides a number of rich assert methods (which are actually wrappers
around the underlying unittest asserts) which are very useful since they can
compare specific details of types and provide detail comparisons. The problem
is that they assert that they are passed a specific type rather than a
type-like object.
