"""Script to find all declarative test files.

This script finds shader_test, glslparsertest, or asmparsertest files and
writes the list to a files. It is used in CMake to know when to trigger a
rebuild of the profile.xml files.  It doesn't check the generated tests because
it is already possible rely on CMake's targets to trigger a rebuild of the
profiles if any of those change.
